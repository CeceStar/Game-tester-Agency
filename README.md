A 24h project in the design module called "passion project". We were supposed to create a landingpage for something we felt passioned about or an idea we had. Since I love boardgames I just decided to got for it, no time to waste (haha!).

I was actually surpriced that I could produce this under 24h and felt proud of being able to present something that looks okay :)
